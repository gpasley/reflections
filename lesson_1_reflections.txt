What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
  
  - Pro: work is constantly saved
  - Con: Needless work may be saved.  May be too frequent
  
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 - Git shows that the files may be interconnected. People tend to work with only one file at a time in Google Docs
 
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
